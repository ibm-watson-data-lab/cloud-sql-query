    "This notebook contains a demonstration on how to use IBM Cloud SQL Query (SQL Query) in a Jupyter Notebook with PixieDust to visualize traffic accidents on a map throughout LA. We'll use SQL Query to search for traffic accidents occurring between 5pm and 8pm and have victims whose ages are between 20 and 35. We've taken care of uploading the data set to IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) for you so you don't need to download and then upload the data set to your COS bucket.\n",
